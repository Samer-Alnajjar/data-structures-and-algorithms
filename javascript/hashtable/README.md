[HashTable Code](./hashtable.js)

----------------------

# Hashtables
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Hash table is a type of data structure to find element very fast. 


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
We want to use four methods for hash table:
- add:takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
- get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
- contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
- hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

I wrote the functions then the tests. I don't know how to do the opposite yet.

The big O:
- space: O(1)
- time: O(1)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->

- **add**:takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
- **get**: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
- **contains**: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
- **hash**: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.
