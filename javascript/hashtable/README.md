[HashTable Code](./hashtable.js)

----------------------

# Graph
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Graph is a type of DataStructure. 


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
We want to use four methods for hash table:
addVertex(): to add a node
addDirectedEdge(): to add an edge 
getVerteces(): to get node 
getNeighbors(): get the node neighbors
size(): number nodes

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

I wrote the functions then the tests. I don't know how to do the opposite yet.

The big O:
- space: O(1)
- time: O(1)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->

**addVertex**: to add a node
**addDirectedEdge**: to add an edge 
**getVerteces**: to get node 
**getNeighbors**: get the node neighbors
**size**: number nodes
