# Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Trees are a hierarchal data structure unlike the arrays and the linked lists.
## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create binary tree and binary search tree and 
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Create a tree class and binary search tree.

- Binary Tree Big O:
time: O(n)
space: O(h)

- Binary Search Tree Big O:
time: O(n)
space:O(h)


## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->

Binary Tree 
- preOrder: creates a tree (Root - Left - Right)
- inOrder: creates a tree (Left - Root - Right) 
- postOrder: it creates a tree (left - Right - Root)

Binary Search Tree add: creates a sorted tree.
- contain: it finds if a specific value is in the tree.
- add: add a number in the binary tree.
