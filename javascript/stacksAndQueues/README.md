# Stacks and Queues
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Here we are introduced to the Stack and Queue data structure.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a Stack and Queue data structure with their methods (Push(), pop(), peek())

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I used linked lists with stack and queues, because it was required from the code challenge.

Big O:
Time: O(1)
Space: O(1)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Stack and Queue-->
peek() => Will return the last node from the Stack and the first Node from Queue.
push() => Will add a node at the top of the Stack and add a node at the back of Queue.
pop() => Will remove the top node from the Stack and remove a node at the front of Queue.
isEmpty() => Will return true if empty, will return false if it's not empty.
